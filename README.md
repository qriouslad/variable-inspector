Easily dump and centrally inspect your PHP variables for convenient debugging.

## Description

**Variable Inspector** allows you to easily dump your PHP variables and display them in a visually clean manner at a central location to help you conveniently do some code debugging work.

It aims to be an **easy and useful enough debug tool**. Perhaps somewhere between traditional [var_dump()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.var-dump.php) and something full-blown like [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org/). No debug info will be shown to site visitors, and the variable content is nicely formatted for review on the inspector page in wp-admin. Also, because it is a regular WordPress plugin, you simply plug-and-play with no complicated configuration required.

Variable Inspector is inspired by [WP Logger](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-data-logger/) and [Ray](https://myray.app/).


### How to Use

Simply place the following line anywhere in your code after the `$variable_name` you'd like to inspect:

`do_action( 'inspect', [ 'variable_name', $variable_name ] );`

If you'd like to record the originating PHP file and line number, append the PHP magic constants `__FILE__` and `__LINE__` as follows.

`do_action( 'inspect', [ 'variable_name', $variable_name, __FILE__, __LINE__ ] );`

This would help you locate and clean up the inspector lines once you're done debugging.
